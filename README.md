Embark on a data-driven journey through the bustling streets of Seoul! This project taps into the city's vibrant heartbeat by predicting bike rental demands with precision. Utilizing a rich dataset from 2017-2018, I navigated through complex patterns of weather variations, holiday impacts, and hourly usage trends.

The adventure involved harnessing the power of Linear and Support Vector Regression models, fine-tuned with hyperparameter optimization to achieve a marked improvement in prediction accuracy. My passion for data storytelling is reflected in the detailed visualizations and insightful analyses that make urban mobility patterns not only understandable but also actionable.

This project was a thrilling blend of challenge and creativity, providing me with a profound appreciation for the nuances of machine learning in real-world applications. It demonstrated the potential of predictive analytics to revolutionize urban planning and resource management in metropolitan areas.
